## Core Features:

- XML Import: Provide an upload field where users can submit their DMARC report XML files.
- Aggregate Stats: Display a table summarizing key statistics extracted from the DMARC report such as total emails, SPF pass/fail rates, DKIM pass/fail rates, and policy disposition (none, quarantine, reject).
- Data Visualization: Generate interactive charts to visualize the DMARC data such as the volume of emails from different source IPs, authentication results over time, and the impact of DMARC policy enforcement. Use a charting library to create responsive and customizable graphs.
- AI-Driven Insights: Incorporate a text generation AI tool to summarize the findings from the DMARC report, highlight key issues, and recommend actionable steps to improve email authentication and deliverability. Summarize the current impact using conversational language, such as 'Your DMARC configuration is not as strict as it could be.'
