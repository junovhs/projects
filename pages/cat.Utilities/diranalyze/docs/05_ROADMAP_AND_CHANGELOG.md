# Roadmap and Changelog

This document outlines the planned development path (Roadmap) for DirAnalyze and a log of notable changes made in each version (Changelog).

## Part 1: Roadmap

### Version 0.1 - UI Prototype (Done - 2025-06-05)
- [x] Browser-based UI for project loading and visualization.
- [x] Live local file editing via the File System Access API.
- [x] AI Debriefing Assistant for context generation.
- [x] AI Patcher with direct local file system writing.
- [x] Removal of obsolete UI components (Combine Mode).

### Version 0.2 - Core Backend Bootstrap (Target Q3 2025)
- [x] CLI `serve` command; proxy to OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama.
- [x] Deterministic hash log v1 (SQLite schema for versioning: ProjectVersions, VersionFiles, OperationLog).
- [x] Backend API for initial project snapshot (Version 0).
- [ ] Frontend: Calculate file hashes & send initial snapshot data to backend API (Issue #21).
- [ ] Backend: API & Logic for subsequent version snapshots (post-patch) (Issue #22).
- [ ] Tree-sitter parsers: Swift & JS (Issue #20).
- [ ] Sketch index builder + budget walker (Hierarchical Semantic Sketch foundation).
- [ ] TruffleHog gate â€” hard fail on secret detection before LLM send.

### Version 0.3 - CLI Alpha & Versioning Enhancements (Planned)
- [ ] UI: Display version history timeline (Issue #23).
- [ ] Core: Restore project to a selected version (Issue #24).
- [ ] Backend: Store and use file diffs for versioning optimization (Issue #25).
- [ ] 10-prompt retrieval benchmark vs. naive FTS (for Semantic Sketch evaluation).
- [ ] Config file `~/.config/diranalyze.toml` (stores key, model, budget).
- [ ] GitHub sync script v2 (labels, milestones auto-sync from a config file).

### Version 0.4 - GUI Alpha (Planned)
- [ ] Embedded web-view UI (exploring Tauri, Wails, or similar instead of Electron).
- [ ] "Log" tab with live hash stream (including versioning events, operation log entries).
- [ ] Key storage UI (for LLM API keys, encrypted on disk).

### Version 0.5 - Plugin Runner API (Planned)
- [ ] gRPC runner interface (`Spawn`, `Exec`, `FetchLog`).
- [ ] Example Python runner (system interpreter).
- [ ] Security sandbox spec for runners.
