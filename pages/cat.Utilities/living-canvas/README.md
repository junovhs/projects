# Project: Living Canvas

This project aims to create a 'post-spreadsheet' application that fundamentally rethinks how users interact with structured and semi-structured data. The core paradigm is a shift from the rigid row-column grid to an intuitive, graph-based model of **Items**, **Links**, and **Lenses**.

## Vision

The Living Canvas is a local-first tool that empowers users to build living information systems as easily as writing a note. It prioritizes user ownership of data, intuitive direct manipulation, and a fluid user experience. It is designed to solve complex data transformation and relationship management problems (the 'Brenda Test') without requiring users to become database administrators.

## Key Concepts

*   **Items**: Any 'thing' a user wants to track (a person, project, task, etc.).
*   **Links**: The relationships between Items, treated as first-class objects.
*   **Lenses**: Dynamic, editable views (Canvas, List, Table, Kanban) of the underlying data.
*   **Workflow Automation**: Reusable 'Smart Connectors' for import, a 'Rule Canvas' for transformation, and 'Custom Exports' for output, designed to automate repetitive data chores.

## Status

The project has completed a rigorous conceptual and logical validation phase. The architecture is designed to be resilient, scalable for local-first use, and secure. This repository contains all historical research, design documents, and logical prototypes required to begin formal development.
