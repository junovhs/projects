# Technical Audit v1 (TFS-6)

**VERDICT:** NO-GO (composite 3.7 / 5; Scalability 3.4 / 5 & Maintainability 3.4 / 5 < 3.5).

**Dimension**	**Wt**	**Score**	**Evidence Gaps**
Technical Complexity	20 %	4.1	Radon threshold set (≤15) but scan not executed on repo
Resource Fit	15 %	3.8	Staffing plan for Rust / Swift UI still unproved
Architectural Soundness	25 %	3.7	Cohesion / coupling figures remain simulated; no real scan
Integration Stability	15 %	3.5	Importer pytest suite present; coverage %, SLA drills absent
Scalability Capacity	15 %	3.4	Locust harness present; zero P95/throughput curves supplied
Maintainability Index	10 %	3.4	CI YAML drafted; Sonar gate & Radon job not run, debt baseline missing

**Dynamic-Risk Register (computed)**

*   **Merge engine** = (7 × 9) / 4 ≈ 16 > 7.5 → BLOCKER (prototype only, no MTTR metrics)
*   **Local-first sync** = 18 > 7.5 → BLOCKER (V1 “file-lock” strategy untested)
*   **CSV import** = 10 > 7.5 → remediation pending full contract-test pass matrix & dead-letter handling

**Mandatory next actions (all blocking):**

1.  Execute scans & publish artifacts – run Radon, Sonar, and module-dependency analysis; attach reports, trend charts, and tech-debt baseline < 2 %.
2.  Generate empirical load data – run Locust against 1.1 M-node dataset; deliver raw P95 latency and throughput curves; target ≤100 ms/operation, ±5 % throughput at max load.
3.  Measure merge MTTR – instrument prototype, resolve 50 worst-case conflicts, show mean time ≤ 5 min and zero data loss.
4.  Close import/export risk – prove contract-test suite passes 100 % malformed-input scenarios and logs non-blocking warnings.
5.  Demonstrate CI enforcement – provide at least two green pipeline runs showing complexity ≤15/method and no debt-ratio regression.

Resubmit only after all metrics are empirical and every risk score <7.5.
