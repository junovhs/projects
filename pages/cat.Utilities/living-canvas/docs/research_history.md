# Research & Iteration History

This document summarizes the entire thought process and development of the "Living Canvas" concept.

## Phase 1: Initial Brainstorming & AI Analysis

The project began with brainstorming sessions focused on creating a next-generation, AI-friendly spreadsheet. Key themes included moving beyond the row-column paradigm, using graph databases or knowledge graphs, and creating a more intuitive UI. AI analysis of these sessions helped prioritize the most promising ideas.

## Phase 2: The "Steve Jobs" Persona & Vision Setting

To sharpen the product vision, a "Steve Jobs" persona was adopted. This forced a ruthless pivot away from a feature-centric, AI-dependent model to a user-centric philosophy focused on:

*   **Insane Simplicity:** The core interaction must be intuitive and obvious.
*   **Direct Empowerment:** The user must feel in control, not the software or an AI.
*   **Standalone Power:** The application must be a local-first tool, not a cloud service, ensuring user ownership of data.

This phase produced the core "Living List/Canvas" concept and the Item/Link/Lens interaction model.

## Phase 3: The "Brenda Test" & Workflow Automation

To ground the vision in a real-world problem, a complex user journey (the "Brenda Test") involving repetitive, error-prone data transformation in Excel was analyzed. This led to the design of a three-part workflow automation engine:

1.  **The Smart Connector:** For intelligent, reusable data import and mapping.
2.  **The Rule Canvas:** For declarative, no-code business logic and data enrichment.
3.  **The Custom Export:** For generating clean, targeted output for external systems.

Logical prototypes for this entire engine were successfully built and tested.

## Phase 4: The Technical Auditor & Hardening

To ensure the concept was viable, a series of increasingly rigorous "Auditor" personas were created, based on research into professional software auditing and feasibility analysis.

*   **First Principles Auditor:** Gave a "PROVISIONAL GO" contingent on proving the core user experience and workflow.
*   **TFS-6 Auditor:** Introduced a formal, metrics-driven engineering scorecard. This forced the project to produce concrete technical artifacts instead of purely conceptual ones.
*   **Red Team Systems Architect:** Performed a final, adversarial review focused on failure modes, security, and data integrity. This audit declared the initial architecture "Brittle" and issued a set of non-negotiable "Hardening Requirements."

## Phase 5: Final Validation

The project concluded by addressing the Red Team's hardening requirements at a logical and architectural level, creating a final, robust blueprint for development. This repository contains all the key artifacts from this entire process, providing a complete history and a clear path forward.
